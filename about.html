        <h1>about</h1>

        <p>
            Having grown up in the 2000s, I can’t help but romanticize the early days of the internet as a vast frontier of quirky personal sites and unprecedented global connection. I love the way creatives took advantage of this medium to democratize knowledge and express ideas in new, interactive ways. This site is inspired by those early web design aesthetics, and is coded entirely by hand in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by yours truly! 
        </p>

        <p>
            Please come by again if you’d like– I’ll be adding new projects and surprises to spark joy as I become better friends with the front end stack and grow as a designer-developer. 
        </p>

        <h2>My Design Philosophy</h2>

                <h4>Curiosity</h4>
                <p>
                    From overheard conversations to machine learning diagrams, I'm looking for inspiration everywhere. I'm fascinated by the way art touches everything we do, and aim to center interdisciplinarity in my work– I'll never say no to an opportunity to pick up a new skill. 
                </p>

            <article class="block">
                <h4>Culture</h4>
                <p>
                    Creative works should be authentic to the people they're meant to serve. My creative process centers co-creation with my audience and users to create products that truly resonate. I'm an avid reader and aspiring polyglot, and I'm drawn to anything that brings me closer to my community. 
                </p>

            <article class="block">
                <h4>Collaboration</h4>
                <p>
                    Together we are greater than the sum of our parts. I've worked with developers, data analysts, musicians, physicians, and waste management specialists, and every lesson I take with me forward into my next project. My greatest talent is being able to communicate my process and insights to anyone.
